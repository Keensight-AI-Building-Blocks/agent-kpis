Furthermore, a comparison of the U.S. nuclear policy with that of other countries, like China, might provide a broader context for the discussion.",of a lot of infrastructure including Vehicles including heat both in your home from heat pumps and Industrial heat which is going to require a lot of electricity if we Electrify it which we should industrial heat is just heating stuff up for industrial purposes whether that's boiling off orange juice to make concentrate or doing all the stuff you need to make steel but there's also another reason why we suddenly need to make more electricity or want to and we're going to talk about that soon but first we have to see what the US government has actually done to address this and maybe open up the possibility for more nuclear to be built in the US are there actually steps being taken this is part of my case and June 6th of 2024 Congress passes the advance act to facilitate us development of advanced nuclear reactors this was passed by both houses of Congress and then signed by by Joe Biden and it is now a law it is a change thing that is intended to boost nuclear reactor deployment in the; of a lot of infrastructure including Vehicles including heat both in your home from heat pumps and Industrial heat which is going to require a lot of electricity if we Electrify it which we should industrial heat is just heating stuff up for industrial purposes whether that's boiling off orange juice to make concentrate or doing all the stuff you need to make steel but there's also another reason why we suddenly need to make more electricity or want to and we're going to talk about that soon but first we have to see what the US government has actually done to address this and maybe open up the possibility for more nuclear to be built in the US are there actually steps being taken this is part of my case and June 6th of 2024 Congress passes the advance act to facilitate us development of advanced nuclear reactors this was passed by both houses of Congress and then signed by by Joe Biden and it is now a law it is a change thing that is intended to boost nuclear reactor deployment in the; of a lot of infrastructure including Vehicles including heat both in your home from heat pumps and Industrial heat which is going to require a lot of electricity if we Electrify it which we should industrial heat is just heating stuff up for industrial purposes whether that's boiling off orange juice to make concentrate or doing all the stuff you need to make steel but there's also another reason why we suddenly need to make more electricity or want to and we're going to talk about that soon but first we have to see what the US government has actually done to address this and maybe open up the possibility for more nuclear to be built in the US are there actually steps being taken this is part of my case and June 6th of 2024 Congress passes the advance act to facilitate us development of advanced nuclear reactors this was passed by both houses of Congress and then signed by by Joe Biden and it is now a law it is a change thing that is intended to boost nuclear reactor deployment in the; 1990 and then none pretty much none though we have had one new one go online just now the voked old unit three which is a big deal like we actually did get another one online but I think that the United States government uh is a little bit looking at what China is up to right now and maybe some people on one side of the aisle are thinking boy it would be good to create a big Mega project that would employ people and also compete with China I guess probably both sides of the aisle are pretty much feeling that Vibe and then one has the extra incen of being like Oh my God there's a crisis in the climate and we need to produce power especially as demand for electricity goes up which is going to happen for two reasons when we thought it was just one we thought there was going to be an electrification of a lot of infrastructure including Vehicles including heat both in your home from heat pumps and Industrial heat which is going to require a lot of electricity if we Electrify it which we
Are there any unclear sections in the transcript?,"Yes, there are unclear sections in the transcript.

Does the transcript provide a comprehensive overview of the topic?,"The transcript provides insights into the potential resurgence of nuclear power and discusses the complexities of energy consumption, particularly in relation to the ""duck curve.""
